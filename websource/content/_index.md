Deep Discovery is a deep learning package focused on medical and biological data analysis. We hope to provide basic capabilities to help develop tools that can be used for both scientific discovery and application in the clinic.

Deep Discovery includes:

- Trained models for MRI segmentation of the brain, with more to come
- A Python API with features for managing data, training models, and easy to override model classes that you can customize
- A Qt GUI is planned

View the [tutorials](/tutorials/) to learn how to [install](/tutorials/installation/) and use Deep Discovery to [perform medical image processing tasks](/tutorials/brainsegmentation/), train your own models, or develop new models.

[Download](http://github.com/robb-brown/DeepDiscovery) from GitHub.

Requires Python 3.x, which can be obtained from python.org if your system doesn't already have it.  Pip should install the other requirements, although on some systems you may need to install TensorFlow yourself.
